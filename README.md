# Chessgame

#### Chessgame is an application allowing 2 players to choose from 5 starting chess board and play locally. It was made during my INF1015 advanced object oriented programming class as a team of 2 people.
### Unfortunatly due to school restrictions, we can't make the code public. The goal of this repository is to give an idea of the project.

### The purpose of this project is to learn and practice concepts related to:
> - C++ and object oriented programming
> - Simple unit tests using Google Tests
> - MVC
> - QT

### I personaly mostly worked on the business layer of the application
